# Social Media Feature Clone Project

This project aims to replicate several key features of the popular social media platform X. Currently, it includes functionalities such as login, register, logout, verify-email, forgot-password, and follow. The project is built using TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Features (Currently, Update soon)

- **Forgot Password:** Users can reset their passwords in case they forget them.
- **Follow:** Users can follow other users to stay updated with their activities.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that provides scalability, flexibility, and performance for handling large volumes of data.
